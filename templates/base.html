                            Sometimes, we may process your personal information when it is in the legitimate interests of another company, such as another Stake Advisor Company.

                            We may transfer, store or process your personal information outside of the Kenya. The laws in some countries may not provide as much legal protection for your personal information as in the Kenya.

                            By submitting your personal information, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. Where we use service providers outside the Kenya, we rely on approved data transfer mechanisms (for example, the EU Standard Contractual Clauses and the EU-US
                            Privacy Shield) to ensure that your personal information is adequately safeguarded in the recipient country.

                            Unfortunately, transmission of information over the internet is not completely secure. We will do our best to protect your personal information, but we cannot guarantee its security and any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your
                            personal information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.
